# Maze Solver Robot

## About
The objective from this activity is to create a robot will achieve finish point from maze, starting in the center from it. Using 3D-made pieces and sensors the this little kart will follow the algorithm to achieve the end of circuit.

## Why
This project has creation based in other projects and examples that already have been created 
about this problem we have to find out.

The avaliation requires we build this kart, creating code and assembling electronic pieces individually.

## Built with
- Sharp (210A21) - distance sensor
- QTD - bright sensor, to detect lines from road
- Bluetooth sensor - for commands recognition from external devices
- H-bridge - essential part to make engines work with direct communication
- Arduino - Arduino Uno ou Nano
